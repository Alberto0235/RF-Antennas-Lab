## üìå Overview

This repository collects all the laboratory works carried out during the **RF Antennas Laboratory course**, providing a complete record of the six practical sessions performed. Each lab includes detailed reports, simulations, and in some cases, project files used for antenna and RF circuit design, measurement, and analysis.

The six laboratories included are:

1. **Lab 01 ‚Äì Power Balance in Resonant Circuits**  
   Investigation of power balance in resonant vs. off-resonant dipole circuits, including numerical computations of radiated power, radiation resistance, and directivity gain. 4NEC simulations were performed for different dipole lengths, alongside MATLAB scripts for data analysis.

2. **Lab 02 ‚Äì Electromagnetic Dipole Design and Construction**  
   Design, simulation, and construction of a dipole antenna. CST Studio Suite was used for optimizing geometry, feed, and directivity, while the antenna was practically realized on FR-4 substrate with SMA connectors and tested using a nanoVNA.

3. **Lab 03 ‚Äì Patch Antenna Design and Construction**  
   Design and implementation of a microstrip patch antenna. The lab included simulations to optimize dimensions and feed using AWR, and practical construction with adhesive copper on a substrate. Performance was verified with nanoVNA measurements.

4. **Lab 04 ‚Äì Directional Coupler Design**  
   Analysis, design, and realization of a directional coupler using AWR. The lab involved TXLine-based optimization, S-parameter analysis, and practical fabrication of the coupler on an FR-4 substrate, followed by measurement verification with a nanoVNA.

5. **Lab 05 ‚Äì PIFA Antenna Tuning with CST**  
   Retuning a PIFA antenna from 3.45 GHz to 3.2 GHz using CST. Parameter sweeps on patch width and feeding position were carried out. Two configurations were tested (Rogers substrate and air), analyzing S11, directivity, IEEE gain, realized gain, and 2D/3D radiation patterns, along with efficiency comparison.

6. **Lab 06 ‚Äì Stub Adapter Design**  
   Design and tuning of a stub adapter at 2.1 GHz. The project combined simulation in AWR with practical construction on Isola DE104 FR-4 substrate. Parameters were optimized, and S11 measurements were performed using a nanoVNA to verify performance.
