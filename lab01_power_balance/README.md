# Lab 01 â€“ Power Balance in Resonant Circuits

**Course:** RF Antennas Laboratory (Bachelor, University of Bologna)  
**Date of work:** March 25, 2024  
**Contributors:** Project developed as part of a course. Collaborators are not listed here.

## ðŸ“Œ Short Summary
- Power balance on a resonant circuit (resonant vs off-resonant conditions).  
- Numerical computation of radiated power, radiation resistance and directivity gain for dipoles at 2l = 0.25Î» and 2l = 1.2Î».  
- 4NEC simulations: radiation pattern, gain, SWR and reflection coefficient around the working frequency (2 GHz).

## ðŸ“‚ Included Files
- `Homework1_Report.pdf` â€” Full report (English).  
- `Dipole_0.25lambda.nec` â€” NEC model for the 0.25Î» dipole.  
- `Dipole_1.2lambda.nec` â€” NEC model for the 1.2Î» dipole.  
- `plot_ddr_dipole.m` â€” MATLAB script used to compute radiation resistance, radiated power and directivity gain.

## How to reproduce
1. Open NEC models with 4NEC2 (or compatible NEC viewer) and run the simulations.  
2. Run `plot_ddr_dipole.m` in MATLAB (or Octave) to reproduce radiation resistance and gain results.
