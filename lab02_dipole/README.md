# Lab 02 â€“ Electromagnetic Dipole Design and Construction

**Course:** RF Antennas Laboratory (Bachelor, University of Bologna)  
**Date of work:** April 7, 2024  
**Contributors:** Project developed as part of a course. Collaborators are not listed here.

## ðŸ“Œ Short Summary
This project involves the design, simulation, and practical construction of an electromagnetic dipole antenna. The design was performed using **CST Studio Suite**, with simulations to optimize the geometry, feed, and directivity of the dipole. The practical construction used **adhesive copper on an FR-4 substrate**, with an **SMA female connector** for feeding. Antenna performance was verified using a **nanoVNA**.
