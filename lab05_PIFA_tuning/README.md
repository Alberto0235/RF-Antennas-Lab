# Lab 05 â€“ PIFA Antenna Tuning with CST

**Course:** RF Antennas Laboratory (Bachelor, University of Bologna)  
**Date of work:** May 25, 2024  
**Author:** Alberto Marrone

## ðŸ“Œ Short Summary

In this laboratory, the task was to retune a **PIFA antenna modeled in CST**, originally operating at 3.45 GHz, so that it resonated instead at 3.2 GHz. The process involved carrying out **parameter sweeps on the patch width and the feeding position**, which progressively shifted the resonance frequency until the target value was reached.

Two main configurations were then investigated in order to compare their performance:

**PIFA with Rogers substrate**, which after tuning achieved resonance at 3.2 GHz with an efficiency of about **15.6%**.
**PIFA with air substrate**, where the absence of dielectric material led to a significant increase in efficiency, reaching around **67.9%** after re-optimization.

For both cases, complete sets of results were produced, including **S11 plots, directivity, IEEE gain, realized gain, 2D radiation diagrams, and 3D far-field radiation patterns**. The comparison highlights how substrate choice strongly affects antenna efficiency, even when the resonance frequency is correctly adjusted.
